# SPATIAL MAPPING USING TIME-OF-FLIGHT

## **Device Overview**

The world is presented in three dimensions - a world in which entities can only be measured by length, width, and height. 3D models can be a good representation of the three-dimensional world and provide unparalleled detail and accuracy. Compared with 2D graphics, 3D models can construct real-world and imaginary shapes and display them more intuitively. It provides a level of design depth that 2D designs cannot.[1] What’s more, the Commercial Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) equipment is expensive and bulky. As an engineer, seeking the accuracy of physical phenomena while minimizing cost is the ultimate goal. As a result, this device will use a timing-of-flight sensor to acquire the surrounding data. Using a rotary mechanism to provide a 360-degree measurement of distance within a single vertical geometric plane (e.g., y-z). This device will operate at a fixed distance along an orthogonal axis (e.g., x-axis). The mapped y-z information will be stored in onboard memory and communicated to a personal computer. The PC will use a third software application (e.g., python) to construct the acquired information and present a 3D model.[2]

## **General Description**

This device is using the Microcontroller MSP432E401Y. It is a low-cost evaluation platform for SimpleLink Arm Cortex-M4F-based Ethernet microcontrollers. The Ethernet LaunchPad development kit design highlights the MSP432E401Y microcontroller with its on-chip 10/100 Ethernet MAC and PHY, USB 2.0, hibernation module, motion control pulse-width modulation, and a multitude of simultaneous serial connectivity. It also features two user switches, four user LEDs, up to 40 I/O pins, dedicated reset, and wake switches [3].

The VL53L1X timing-of-flight sensor (ToF) measures the distance by using LIDAR. The LIDAR is named Light Detection and Ranging, it first emits a tiny pulse of light(940nm). When the light hits an object, it will return back to the sensor. Moreover, it can measure how long it takes for emitted pulses of light to reach the nearest object and reflect back to the detector. The measured distance can be calculated as equal to the (photon travel time/2) * Speed of light.

The MSP432E401Y Microcontroller will be used as a link from the sensor to the PC. The sensor will be connected to the GPIO ports of the MCU by wires and transfer the data from the sensor to the controller. The controller will send the received data to the PC for further data processing and visualization.

The 28BYJ-48 stepper motor is driven by the VMA401-ULN2003 interface board. It is programmable to rotate with precise angles, speed, and directions. By fastening the sensor to the motor rotation rod, the motor will rotate each 22.5degrees and sensor detecting the ranging distance in that rotation angle. The measured distance can be converted into x,y,z coordinates for constructing 3D model by using Python program.

## **Detailed Description**

To measure the planar spatial distance, the VL53L1X Time of Flight (ToF) sensor will be used and predesigned on a breakout board as shown in the picture below. The sensor is mounted to a stepper motor following the rotation motion of the motor. As an output high from the push button is being detected, the whole system will start working. The microcontroller will first initialize the sensor to get ready for the ranging process,as the ranging process finishes. The stepper motor will start rotating 22.5 degrees in a counterclockwise direction 16 times to finish a one 360 rotation. In each rotation, it will be used Systick_wait() function to wait for 40ms to finish a series of tasks. The microcontroller will get the ranging data (measured distance) from the sensor via I2C and communicate the microcontroller to the PC through UART to allow the PC to print the measured distance in Python. This design will perform four rotations in either counterclockwise or clockwise direction to avoid the wire wrapping together during the rotation. There will be a total of 64 ranging data (measured distance) to pass from the sensor through the microcontroller to the PC for each 22.5degrees. The data will be transferred one at a time and it can be visualized in real-time through python. For each data transfer, the python algorithm will be used to convert the measured distance and store them in the data point cloud for future data visualization.![Aspose.Words.ffaede76-6756-4ac4-879d-8b86fb4cc76b.006](/assets/Aspose.Words.ffaede76-6756-4ac4-879d-8b86fb4cc76b.006.jpeg)

The circuit schematic of the device can be found [here](#Circuit Schematics).

### **Distance Measurement**

The relationship of distance, time and speed can be expressed as the following expression:

​																				𝐷 = 𝑠 × ∆𝑡

The VL53L1X is a state-of-the-art, Time-of-Flight (ToF), laser-ranging sensor, enhancing the ST FlightSenseTM product family. It is the fastest miniature ToF sensor on the market with accurate ranging up to 4 m and fast ranging frequency up to 50 Hz.[3]

It uses the time of flight (ToF) of invisible, eye-safe laser pulses to measure absolute distances independent of ambient lighting conditions and target characteristics like color, shape, and texture (though these things will affect the maximum range). The VL53L1X also features a programmable region of interest (ROI), so the full field of view can be reduced or divided into multiple zones.[4]

The VL53L1X offers three distance modes: short, medium, and long. Short distance is mode is mostly immune to ambient light but limited with the ranging distance which the maximum ranging distance is 1.3m(4.4 ft). This device is going to mainly apply to construct the 3D model of a regular house hallway, to meet most of the hallway ranging distance.

To successfully measure the distance from the detected object to the sensor. The ToF sensor will emit a pulse of light(940nm) as introduced before from the emitter side. As the light hits the object, it will return back to the sensor. The onboard ranging core will measure the time takes for emitted pulses of light to reach the nearest object and be reflected back to the detector. Based on the relationship of distance, speed and time introduced before, the photon(pulses) travel time from the emitter to the detecting object can be dived by two from the total travelling time and the measured distance can be calculated as the following expression.

​																				𝐷 = 𝑐 × ∆𝑡 2

The speed of light is expressed as *c* and is a constant value equal to 299,792,458m/s. To interact with the VL53L1x, the manufacturer(ST) provides an application programming interface(API). By correctly configuring the initializing of the sensor by setting API functions on the microcontroller, the distance data will be transferred one at a time after the motor 22.5degrees via I2C. Below is a basic flow chart to use the API.

![Aspose.Words.ffaede76-6756-4ac4-879d-8b86fb4cc76b.007](/assets/Aspose.Words.ffaede76-6756-4ac4-879d-8b86fb4cc76b.007.jpeg)

The microcontroller will communicate through UART by setting the same BAUD rate 115200 on PC. The PC will synchronize the data instantly by using python to decode the measured distance into string format. It is important to notice that the string format need to be converted into integer or float data type to perform the math operation. This can be simply done by using int(measured_distance).

To convert the measured distance into spatial distance (y-z plane). The stepper motor rotation degree will be used as a reference angle for the measure distance to calculate the y and z coordinates. The formula to calculate y and z within a given angle can be expressed below.

​															𝑦 = cos (𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑟) ∗ 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑_𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒

​															𝑧 = sin (𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑟) ∗ 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑_𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒

The x distance will increment one meters after one motor rotation. The x, y and z coordinates will be all written into the previous created xyz 3D model file for further data visualization. (The flowchart of the microcontroller can be found [here](#Microcontroller)).

Let’s take an example, after the motor rotate 90degrees into the first clockwise direction. The sensor is detecting an object and calculated the distance is 2000mm. The microcontroller has finished its sensor initializing and receiving this ranging distance 2000mm. It sends the 2000 to the PC via UART, PC uses the python program to decode the 2000 into the string format and then convert it into integers. The python algorithm will perform cos(90)*2000 and sin(90)*2000 to get the y and z coordinates which are y=0, z=2000. Since it is in the first clockwise rotation, x will be set to zero. The xyz(0,0,2000) will be plotted as point in the 3D model file for further data visualization.

### **Visualization**

This device is being tested on the environment below. (The flowchart for the python program can be found [here](#Python Program)).

- Operating System: Windows10
- Python Version: Python 3.9
- UART Port: COM3
- Python libraries required: NumPy, Open3D, Pyserial, math

The communication to pass the data is being accomplished by installing the third library module-pyserial. By correctly setting the UART Port and the baud rate, the user can receive the data from the microcontroller through python.

The Opend3D is a good data visualization third party tool for Python. It will allow the user to create and manipulate the 3D model in the xyz file format.

After the data is being received from the PC and converted into the x,y and z coordinates. The xyz coordinate will be written as a point into the previous created xyz file. Since the data synchronization is real-time, the point will be written one at a time and wait for the next synchronization. After 64 distance measurements and synchronization finished. The xyz point cloud can be load into an Open3D/array. The array can be accessed later for further visualization.

To visualize the point cloud, the following command can be used.

​										`o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([point_cloud_array])`

(Here is an example of the data point cloud graph)

![Aspose.Words.ffaede76-6756-4ac4-879d-8b86fb4cc76b.010](/assets/Aspose.Words.ffaede76-6756-4ac4-879d-8b86fb4cc76b.010.png)

To visualize those data points better and construct a 3D model. LineSet() function from the Open3D module can be used to connect each data points. To avoid directly manipulate the raw distance data, each distance data will be assigned an index number corresponding their original position in the data point cloud. The idea of connecting each point is to connect the plane separately. Firstly, because there are 16 rotations within one cycle, there will be 16 points in the y-z plane within the same x. By following the logic that connect point one to point two and point two to point three by using lines. This will construct a 2D planar graph of the y-z plane. After finish constructing the y-z plane line connections. Their vertices connections between each y-z plane follow the x orthogonal can use the same logic. It is important to notice since the rotation is in counter-clockwise first then into clockwise and following the opposite direction; the assigned first index will be connected to the thirtieth index which is the last vertice of the second rotator motion. And the last index of the first rotation will connect to the first index of the second rotation.

Each line connections assigned can be used lines.append() to add at the last element of the array. By performing the below command, it will map the lines to 3d coordinate vertices.

![Aspose.Words.ffaede76-6756-4ac4-879d-8b86fb4cc76b.011](/assets/Aspose.Words.ffaede76-6756-4ac4-879d-8b86fb4cc76b.011.png)

Finally, the finished 3D model can be visualized through the previous command but with a line set parameter.

  										`o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([line_set])`

## **Limitations**

1. The Cortex-M4F Floating-Point Unit (FPU) can fully support **single-precision** add, subtract, multiply, divide, multiply and accumulate, and square root operations. t also provides conversions between fixed-point and floating-point data formats, and floating-point constant instructions. The FPU provides floating-point computation functionality that is compliant with the ANSI/IEEE Std 754-2008, IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, referred to as the IEEE 754 standard. The FPU's single-precision extension registers can also be accessed as 16 doubleword registers for load, store, and move operations.[5] The microcontroller is also capable to support trigonometric functions, but it is important to notice both the trigonometric calculation of microcontroller and python required the degree convert to radians. This can be done by using the formula.
   $$
   𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒 × 𝜋/180
   $$
   Or directly using the math module from python to convert – *math.radians(degree).*

   However, there is a limitation that the microcontroller is performing the single- precision instead of double-precision that python used. That means when the precision calculation is required, using python will get a more precise result than the FPU unit which is the reason all the trigonometric calculations is performed in python program for this device.

2. The maximum quantization error of the ToF module is equal to the ADC resolution. Therefore, the answer can be calculated as follow.

$$
𝑀𝑎𝑥_{𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑛_{error}} = 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = V_{FS}/2^m= 3.5/2^{12}= 8.54 × 10^{−4}
$$

3. The maximum standard serial communication rate to implement with the PC is 128000 bits per second. This can be verified in the device manager -> Ports -> User UART (COM3,may differ) -> Right Click -> Properties -> Port Settings -> Bits per second. The default is 9600 bits per second, but the user can select up to 128000bps.

4. The microcontroller and the ToF modules are using I2C communication method to realize data transfer. The I2C bus on the VL53L1X has a maximum speed of 400 kbits/s and uses a device address of 0x52.

5. The primary limitation on speed is the stepper motor. The operating frequency of the VMA401 under the reference manual is 100 Hz. As a result, to allow the motor functionally rotate, the time of delay can be calculated as the following expression.
   $$
   𝐷𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦=𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑= 1/𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 = 1/100 =0.01𝑠=10𝑚𝑠
   $$
   That is the reason we need set the SystickWait10ms() function is equal to the 10ms. To test the delay, we can use SystickWait10ms(1) to generate a time delay on a Port, by connecting the positive terminal of oscilloscope to that Port and negative terminal to the ground. The period of each square waveform should equal to 10ms.
